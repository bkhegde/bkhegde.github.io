  <p>If soil pH is &lt;5, apply dolomite 500 g to 1000 g/ plant.&nbsp;</p>
  <p> Plant 2-3 rooted cuttings in the pits at a distance of about 30 cm away from the standards after receiving sufficient rain</p>
  <p> Press the soil around the cuttings to form a small mound slopping outwards and away from the cuttings to prevent water stagnation around the plants.&nbsp;</p>
  <p> Undertake frequent inspection of recently planted vines for pest/disease infestations and take necessary protection measures.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Provide adequate drainage in areas prone to water stagnation. Tie the growing shoots of young vines to the standard.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Undertake slash weeding in the interspaces.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Apply organic manures @ 10 kg/vine and neem cake @ 1 kg/mature vine fortified with Tricoderma and Pochonia with the receipt of monsoon showers (vines more than 3 years of age).&nbsp;</p>
<p> Apply Azospirillum (50 g/vine).&nbsp;</p>
  <p> Apply half the quantity/dose of (NPK50:50:150 g/vine/year as general recommendation i.e Urea 55 g: Rock Phosphate 140 g: muriate of potash 125g) per plant of more than 3 years old and care should be taken to avoid injuries to the vines/roots while applying fertilizers and other intercultural operations.&nbsp;</p>
  <p> Apply 1 kg neem cake, 200 g rock phosphate, 0.5 kg ash and 10 kg cow dung per vine, if organic system is 6 AugustSeptember fo llowed. Apply 150 g sulphate of potash, if potassium deficiency persists in soil.&nbsp;</p>
  <p> Spray black pepper micronutrient mixture @ 5 gm per liter water.&nbsp;</p>
  <p> Undertake foliar spray with Bordeaux mixture 1% followed by soil drenching over a radius of 45-50 cm around the vines with copper oxychloride (0.2%) (@ 2-5 litres per vine), immediately after first monsoon showers, if Phytophthora incidence is noticed.&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>OR&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p> Drench the soil and spray foliage with potassium phosphonate (0.3%) or metalaxyl -mancozeb (0.125%)(@ 2-5 litres per vine).&nbsp;</p>
  <p> Undertake foliar spray with quinalphos (0.05%) to check pollu beetle or top shoot borer. Leaf gall thrips can be controlled by spraying dimethoate (0.05%).&nbsp;</p>
  <p> Apply first round of biocontrol agents (Trichoderma and Pochollia chlamydosporia) along with organic matter/manures.&nbsp;</p>
  <p> Avoid drenching of chemical pesticides, if biocontrol agents are applied.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Seedlings of silver oak and Ailanthus may be planted as support for black pepper.</p>
